## Create an API-Key

<Steps>
### Create an account

To create an account, you can go to the sign-up page [Register](/register). You will get an email to confirm your account. After that, you can sign inÂ [Login](/login), or you can log in with Google or GitHub

### Create an API-Key

1. Navigate to the `Dashboard`
2. If you don't have an active API key, you can click on `Request key` and request an API key. Or if you have an API key, you
   can click on the `Options` button right from our API key and request a completely new one.

   <Callout>If you have an API key and request a new one, the old one won't work anymore.</Callout>

### Making requests

Now you can make request to the API with your API-key. To do that you need to add the API-key in the Header of the request.

```js filename="nodejs"
const options = {
  method: 'GET',
  url: 'https://worlddataapi.com/api/v1/countries'
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  }
};
```
