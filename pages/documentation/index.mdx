# Overview

Thats is the documentation for the Worlddata API. The API is a RESTful API and shows data about countries, states, cities and more.
The API is free to use and you can use it for your own projects. The API is still in development and will be updated frequently.

## Base URL

The base URL for the API is `https://worlddataapi.com/`. All endpoints are relative to this base URL.
For example, the endpoint `countries` is available at `https://worlddataapi.com/countries`.

## Use the API

To Use the API you need an API key. You can get an API key by creating an account. You can create an account [here](https://worlddataapi.com/register).
Too see how to use the API key, see the [How to use the API](/documentation/how-to-use) page.

## Rate Limit

The API has a rate limit of 100 requests per hour, but the 100 requests are only per endpoint. So you can make 100 requests to the `countries` endpoint and 100 requests to the `cities` endpoint.
After you have reached the limit, you will get an error message.
